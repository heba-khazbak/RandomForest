RandomForest v. 0.0.10
======================

Copyright 2016 Henrik Boström

[http://randomforest.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]

A <a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a> package that implements random forests for classification, regression and survival analysis with conformal prediction.
[NOTE: survival analysis under development]

There are two basic ways of working with the package:

- running an experiment with multiple datasets, possibly comparing multiple methods,
  i.e., random forests with different parameter settings, or

- working with a single dataset, to evaluate, generate, store, load or
  apply a random forest

All named arguments below are optional, while the others are mandatory.

The classification datasets included in uci.zip have been downloaded and adapted from:

Lichman, M. (2013). UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science.

The regression datasets included in regression.zip have been downloaded and adapted from the above source and from:

Rasmussen,  C.E.,  Neal,  R.M.,  Hinton,  G.,  van  Camp,  D.,  Revow,  M.,  Ghahramani, Z., Kustra, R., and Tibshirani, R. (1996) Delve data for evaluating learning in valid experiments [http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/datasets.html]

The survival datasets included in survival.zip have been downloaded and adapted from:

To install the package
----------------------

Clone or download the package to some suitable directory.

From this directory, start Julia (which can be downloaded from http://julialang.org/) at a command prompt:

    julia

Install a requested package:

    julia> Pkg.add("DataFrames")

Try to load the RandomForest package (assuming that the current directory is in your load path,
e.g., add "push!(LOAD_PATH, pwd())" to the file ".juliarc.jl" in your home directory):

    julia> using RandomForest

Then exit by:

    julia> exit()

To use the package
------------------

Start Julia at a command prompt:

    julia -p <N>

where \<N\> is the number of cores you would like the code to be executed on, e.g., 24.

Load the package:

    julia> using RandomForests

To run an experiment
--------------------

An experiment is run by calling experiment(...) in the following way:

    julia> experiment(files = <files>, separator = <separator>, protocol = <protocol>,
                      normalizetarget = <normalizetarget>, normalizeinput = <normalizeinput>,
                      methods = [<method>, ...])

The arguments should be on the following format:

    files : list of file names or path to directory (default = ".")
        - in a specified directory, files with extensions other than .txt and .csv are ignored
        - each file should contain a dataset (see format requirements below)
        - example: files = ["uci/house-votes.txt", "uci/glass.txt"],
        - example: files = "uci"

    separator : single character (default = ',')
        - the character to use as field separator
        - example: separator = '\t' (the tab character)

    protocol : integer, float, :cv, :test (default = 10)
        - the experiment protocol:
            an integer means using cross-validation with this no. of folds.
            a float between 0 and 1 means using this fraction of the dataset for testing
            :cv means using cross-validation with folds specified by a column labeled FOLD
            :test means dividing the data into training and test according to boolean values
             in a column labeled TEST (true means that the example is used for testing)
        - example: protocol = 0.25 (25% of the data is for testing)

    normalizetarget : boolean (default = false)
        - true means that each regression value v will be replaced by
          (v-v_min)/(v_max-v_min), where v_min and V-max are the minimum and maximum values
        - false means that the original regression values are kept

    normalizeinput : boolean (default = false)
        - true means that each numeric input value v will be replaced by
          (v-v_min)/(v_max-v_min), where v_min and V-max are the minimum and maximum values
        - false means that the original values are kept

    method : a call on the form forest(...) (default = forest())

        [FIXME: tree() method is missing here]: #
        - The call may have the following (optional) arguments:

            notrees : integer (default = 100)
                - no. of trees to generate in the forest

            minleaf : integer (default = 1)
                - minimum no. of required examples to form a leaf

            maxdepth : integer (default = 0)
                - maximum depth of generated trees (0 means that there is no depth limit)

            randsub : integer, float, :default, :all, :log2, or :sqrt (default = :default)
                - no. of randomly selected features to evaluate at each split:
                   :default means :log2 for classification and 1/3 for regression
                   :all means that all features are used (no feature subsampling takes place)
                   :log2 means that log2 of the no. of features are sampled
                   :sqrt means that sqrt of the no. of features are sampled
                   an integer (larger than 0) means that this number of features are sampled
                   a float (between 0.0 and 1.0) means that this fraction of features are sampled

            randval : boolean (default = true)
                - true means that a single randomly selected value is used to form conditions for each
                  feature in each split
                - false mean that all values are used to form conditions when evaluating features for
                  each split

            splitsample : integer (default = 0)
                - no. of randomly selected examples to use for evaluating each split
                - 0 means that no subsampling of the examples will take place

            bagging : boolean (default = true)
                - true means that a bootstrap replicate of the training examples is used for each tree
                - false means that the original training examples are used when building each tree

            bagsize : float or integer (default = 1.0)
                - no. of randomly selected examples to include in the bootstrap replicate
                - an integer means that this number of examples are sampled with replacement
                - a float means that the corresponding fraction of examples are sampled with replacement

            modpred : boolean (default = false)
                - true means that for each test instance, the trees for which a randomly selected training
                  instance is out-of-bag is used for prediction and the training instance is not used for
                  calculating a calibration score
                - false means that all trees in the forest are used for prediction and all out-of-bag scores
                  are used for calibration

            laplace : boolean (default = false)
                - true means that class probabilities at each leaf node is Laplace corrected
                - false means that class probabilities at each leaf node equal the relative class
                  frequencies

            confidence : a float between 0 and 1 (default = 0.95)
                - probability of including the correct label in the prediction region

            conformal : :default, :std, :normalized or :classcond (default = :default)
                - method used to calculate prediction regions
                - For classification, the following options are allowed:
                   :default is the same as :std
                   :std means that validity is guaranteed in general, but not for each class
                   :classcond means that validity is guaranteed for each class
                - For regression, the following options are allowed:
                   :default is the same as :normalized
                   :std results in the same region size for all predictions
                   :normalized means that each region size is dependent on the spread
                    of predictions among the individual trees

    Examples:

    The call experiment(files = "uci") is hence the same as

    experiment(files = "uci", separator = ´,´, protocol = 10, methods = [forest()])

    The following compares the default random forest to one with 1000 trees and a maxdepth of 10:

    julia> experiment(files = "uci", methods = [forest(), forest(notrees = 1000, maxdepth = 10)])
